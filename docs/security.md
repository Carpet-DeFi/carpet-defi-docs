# Security

At Carpet, we take security seriously.
That's why we use a 3/4<!--5--> multisig for administrative actions, whose members are:

- Operator (developer and CEO)
- Viondar/Nicky (tokenomics expert, affiliated with Grape Finance, Brr Finance and Liquid Capital)
- Andy_Tomb (marketing & social media)
- Cattie (PR)
<!-- - ThatGamerKid/Eric (partnerships, affiliated with Grape Finance and Liquid Capital)-->

We also have an emergency response system to quickly respond to a crisis that can temporarily pause strategies for 24 hours.

Most of our team is also doxxed and are very reputable individuals.

Our smart contracts will be audited by 0xGuard on launch and in the future potentially CertiK or another large auditing firm.

All software has bugs, every programmer makes mistakes! This is beta software.
