# Security

At Carpet, we take security seriously. That's why we use a 4/6 multisig for powerful actions, whose members are the core team. There is also a 48-hour timelock before administrative actions can be taken, so even if 4/6 of the multisig colluded to steal user funds, the community would get time to react.

Our smart contracts will be audited by 0xGuard on launch and in the future potentially CertiK or another large auditing firm.

All software has bugs, every programmer makes mistakes! This is beta software! Don't put too much in.
