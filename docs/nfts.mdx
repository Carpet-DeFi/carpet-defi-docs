# NFTs

Carpet DeFi NFTs work in conjunction with the NFT Airdrop Treasury. Every four weeks, 20% of all value in the NFTAT is used to buy Carpet and that Carpet is then airdropped to holders of Carpet DeFi NFTs.

To be eligible for the airdrop the wallet holding the NFTs must have spent at least 10 USDC on a buy of Carpet since the last airdrop.

In total, Carpet DeFi will mint 8 Tiers of NFTs. For the first round of minting there'll be 3 Tiers and each mint thereafter will add a Tier until the sixth mint includes all 8 Tiers. Each mint will make the art of each Tier unique, meaning that after all 6 mints there are 6 versions each of Tier 1-3, 5 versions of Tier 4, 4 versions of Tier 5, 3 versions of Tier 6, 2 versions of Tier 7, and each of the four Tier 8 NFTs will be fully unique. This will amount to a total of 36 different artworks. Quite a treat for a true
collector.

After all six mints, each Tier will have 1200 shares, for a total of 9600 shares. Each mint will provide an equal part of those 1200 shares for that Tier, as follows.

- 6 mints of 200 Tier 1 NFTs, worth 1 share each
- 6 mints of 100 Tier 2 NFTs, worth 2 shares each
- 6 mints of 50 Tier 3 NFTs, worth 4 shares each
- 5 mints of 30 Tier 4 NFTs, worth 8 shares each
- 4 mints of 15 Tier 5 NFTs, worth 20 shares each
- 3 mints of 8 Tier 6 NFTs, worth 50 shares each
- 2 mints of 5 Tier 7 NFTs, worth 120 shares each
- 1 mint of 4 fully unique Tier 8 NFTs, worth 300 shares each

Mint 1 will be shortly after launch, and thereafter each mint will loosely be planned after active NFT holders have at least come halfway or maybe even fully to ROI (return of investment) through airdrops. Since the NFT airdrops get paid partly out of Carpet trading volume from the Counter and partly out of the successes from the RT, it is expected for the airdrops to increase over time, as more and more people learn
about the success of Carpet DeFi.

As such at each mint the NFTs will become more expensive to reflect their increased value. The mint prices for the first two mints are already decided, and the future mint prices will be revealed over time. This staggered minting favours early investors, but gives latecomers a decent chance as well.
