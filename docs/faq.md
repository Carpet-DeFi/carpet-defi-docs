# Frequently asked questions

A list of some frequently asked questions.

## Which exchange does Carpet use?

Carpet DeFi uses a custom exchange that we call the Counter. It is the only way that supply of CARPET increases during normal protocol operation.

## How is the number-go-up possible?

Price is determined by `backing treasury value / total supply`. When you buy, due to the buy/sell tax, you increase the backing value more than you increase the total supply.

Even if no one buys or sells, the protocol still invests the stablecoin backing into safe yield sources like lending platforms so you still earn money.

## Is this a Ponzi?

Well I mean, if this _was_ a Ponzi scheme, we wouldn't be pointing it out. Do your due diligence, and [read the risks section too](./risks.md).

## Is this a rug?

No, we are a Carpet store.

## Why not just invest stablecoins?

The main reason is because of our Risk Treasury which gets funded through part of the fees, and it invests in higher risk protocols. Even if the Risk Treasury were to lose 100%, it would not affect backing. (although it would be tragic)

## What is the Positive Value Invariant?

Simply, the Positive Value Invariant means that the price of CARPET now is always greater or equal to the price in a previous point in time.

## What is the focus of our protocol?

Carpet DeFi's end goal is to have a sustainable protocol earning revenue, not from user fees, but rather from revenue-generating investments and returns from building new protocols and seeding innovation, which will then go back into financially benefitting investors and also benefitting the overall DeFi community.
