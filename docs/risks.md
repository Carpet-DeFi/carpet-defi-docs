# Risks

No DeFi protocol is without risks, and we’d like to be clear about them.

## Exploits and hacks

All cryptocurrency is code, and code can have mistakes in it. Blockchain developers are like smart contract "lawyers", except the contracts are written in a different and highly specific language. Translating human language to Solidity can generate typos and translation errors, allowing hackers to find loopholes and exploit them. To minimize this risk, we will use static analysis tools and will get our contracts audited by experts in the field.

## Corruption

We have a partially doxxed team working for Carpet DeFi and the doxxed members of that team are on the multisig for non-automated treasury wallets. We trust each other and ourselves.

We are known in the DeFi space and our honour and reputation is more valuable to us than any money we could rug. Also, we are not a rug store, but a Carpet Store. That leaves threats or aggressive crime, but we are still on multisig wallets and not all members on the multisig wallets are doxxed, so even such crime would be as useless as it would be horrible. Once the protocol is stable, we plan to build a governance DAO in the future to further decentralize the project.

## Depegging of stablecoins

Carpet DeFi trusts in the value of certain stablecoins. We spread risk by using multiple stablecoins instead of just one, but the depegging of even one can do a lot to our treasury. We carefully choose these stablecoins, though, and even though depegging happens, it is often only a momentary issue that quickly gets resolved. Also please note that the BT does not loop its investments and does not borrow against assets, so a momentary drop in a stablecoin will not liquidate any of the BT investments.

### Wallet Hack or Scam

This is your personal safety as an investor. We view it as our communal responsibility to continuously educate investors on wallet safety and to fight an ongoing fight against scammers and hackers. Still many people get scammed or hacked and this is regrettable. Always get your information from reputable sources, make sure to double check domain names, be careful of which protocols you allow access to your coins, revoke contracts you’re no longer using, and never ever give anyone your seed phrase.
