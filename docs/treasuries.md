# Contracts & Treasuries

## Backing Treasury

The Backing Treasury guarantees the value of each CARPET. It invests only in safe and secure protocols with stable assets to try and reduce the possibility of loss.

## Genie Sweat Shop

The Genie Sweat Shop splits funds across the Risk Treasury, DAO Treasury and NFT Airdrop Treasury.

### Risk Treasury (RT)

The Risk Treasury, or RT, is a treasury with which the team will invest into other protocols with the aim of acquiring profit for Carpet holders. The Carpet DeFi team's investment department will make trades and investments of its own volition but will also consult the community of Carpet holders via discussions and votes on what the community deems to be good investments.

### NFT Airdrop Treasury (NFTAT)

The NFT Airdrop Treasury, or NFTAT, is a treasury with the express purpose of rewarding Carpet DeFi NFT holders. Before the first NFTs are minted, the NFTAT will simply passively accumulate value. From the first minting onwards, the NFTAT will be used to reward NFT holders once every four weeks by using 20% of its total value to buy Carpet at the Counter and airdrop it to NFT holders.

### DAO Treasury (DAOT)

The DAO Treasury, or DAOT, will take care of the protocol expenses, including gas fees, marketing, site hosting and more.
