Actually, only 60% of the fee is sent to the backing treasury. The other 40% is sent to the risk treasury.

When you purchase CARPET from the Counter, you pay, for example, 100$. The protocol only gives you 80% of that due to the fee, so you get 80 CARPET.

Now, let's see the price formula: `1000 + 100 / 1000 + 80`

The CARPET supply only went up by 80, but the backing value went up by 100! This causes price per CARPET to go up to `1.02`, yay! **Price goes up, because backing increases proportionally more than the supply does.**

Actually, only 60% of the fee is burned. The other 40% is sent to the risk treasury.

Now this time, you're cashing out your gains, selling 80 carpets back to the Counter. The Counter only gives you back 80% of what your carpet is worth, so you get 192$.

Now, let's see the price formula: `30,000 - 192 / 10,000 - 80`. Doing the math, the new price equates to about `3.0048`. **Price goes up, because backing decreases proportionally less than the supply does.**

You decide to give 100 CARPET to your friend, what a nice person you are!

The protocol takes 20 CARPET, burning 15 and doing other stuff with the 5 CARPET. Your friend gets 80 CARPET.

The price of CARPET now goes up. Let's apply the formula: `1000 / 1000 - 20 = 1.0204`. **The total backing value did not change but the supply decreased, meaning price goes up.**
