Except during special events, 60% of the tax is sent to the BT. The other 40% (in the form of USDC) is sent to the GSS.

When you purchase CARPET from the Counter, you pay, for example, 100 USDC. The protocol only gives you 70% of that due to the fee, so you get 70 Carpet. The Backing Treasury however went up by 88 USDC and the Genie Sweat Shop received 12 USDC.

Now, let's see the price formula again: `(1000 + 88) / (1000 + 70) â‰ˆ 1.0168`

The CARPET supply only went up by 70, but the backing value went up by 88 USDC. This causes price per CARPET to go up by ~1.68% to ~1.0168! Price goes up, because BT value increases proportionally more than the supply does.

Actually, only 60% of the fee is burned. The other 40% (in the form of CARPET) is sent to the risk treasury.

:::
You're cashing out, selling 100 carpets back to the Counter. The Counter only gives you back 70% of what your carpet is worth, so you get 70 USDC, 100 Carpet gets burned, the BT loses 82 USDC and the Genie Sweat Shop gets 12 USDC.

Now, let's see the price formula: (1,000 - 82) / (1,000 - 100). Doing the math, the new price increases by 2% to 1.02. Price goes up because BT value decreases proportionally less than the supply does.
