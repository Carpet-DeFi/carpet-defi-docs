# The Counter

The Counter is our custom protocol exchange. Our pricing formula is like this: `price = total backing value / total CARPET supply`

The Counter has the sole, exclusive right to mint CARPET. [It only does so on purchase or sale, with a 30% fee.](./fees) The Counter is an integral part of our protocol. The only way you can trade CARPET is through the Counter.

The sell and buy taxes make sure that the price always goes upwards, [which is known as the Positive Value Invariant.](./positivevalue)
