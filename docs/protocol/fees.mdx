# Fees & Taxes

We enforce taxes on trading & transferring tokens to other wallets.

These fees drive the value upwards, and will be reduced down to 5% in the future, depending on trading volume.

### Exchange Fee

30% exchange fee, meaning you will earn 30% less USD or CARPET. 60% of this fee is sent to the backing treasury and 40% is sent to the risk treasury.

### Transfer Fee

30% transfer fee, meaning the receiver will get 30% less CARPET than you sent. 60% of this fee is burnt and 40% is sent to the risk treasury.
