# Fees & Taxes

We enforce taxes on trading & transferring tokens to other wallets.

These fees drive the value upwards, and will be reduced down to 5% in the future, depending on trading volume.

### Exchange Fee

30% exchange fee, meaning you will earn 30% less USD or CARPET. 60% of this fee is sent to the backing treasury and 40% is sent to the risk treasury.

### Transfer Fee

30% transfer fee, meaning the receiver will get 30% less CARPET than you sent. 60% of this fee is burnt and 40% is sent to the risk treasury.

### Additional allocation fee

The Backing Treasury's stablecoin holdings can become unbalanced in the event of a new backing token being added or some other event, causing added depegging risk and inoptimal deployment of capital across farms, which could hamper the passive growth of the Backing Treasury.

As a result, we will use an extra disincentive to ensure even allocation. This fee will be added on top of the "base fee" and will be split across the Risk & Backing treasuries in the same ratio as how the base fee is split.

The fee will be gradual, with buying CARPET using the stablecoin that the treasury has the least of having a 0% additional fee, and buying CARPET with the largest held stablecoin bearing the maximum allocation fee.

If the difference between the lowest value and highest value pools is less than 10% (of the highest value pool), this extra fee is disabled. This fee is also disabled if there is only one backing token, as it is the sole stablecoin held by the Treasury, and this fee would not make sense.
