# Weaving Rounds

Every great protocol needs to start somewhere, and we too need our investors to help provide us with the resources required to build up the protocol. We do this by holding three weaving rounds. Each weaving round will assume a progressively larger crowd, since a large part of each weaving round revenue will be used for marketing. Those who invest in the earlier weaving rounds will benefit from very low taxes to offset the risk of investing early.

Those who held KEEN or iSKEEN at the moment the snapshot was taken, will receive free Carpet tokens before the first weaving round and after the last weaving round. This will be paid for by the weaving round marketing allocation.

## Weaving Tokens: whitelist rewards

Each Weaving round has its own weaving token. In order, these are Thread, Weave, and Dye. To benefit from the low tax of the weaving round, an investor will need to add an amount of the weaving round token to the transaction equal to the amount of USDC they seek to spend on buying Carpet.

While the weaving tokens provide a huge beneficiary discount, there is nothing stopping an investor from buying at normal launch taxes. It is the addition of the weaving tokens that make the difference, but the buying works fine without. In the same way, selling of Carpet is already available from the get-go. Since our token price goes up on a sell as well, we would never dream of holding anyone back in the selling of our token at any time.

The weaving tokens will be handed out by our team before and during the weaving rounds to reward activity and as giveaways to raise awareness of the beauty of our protocol. They are essentially limited whitelist spots. We chose this way to make sure that active community members still have something tangible to gain by showing activity and support even after they have already received their whitelist, because in this system anyone can continue to get even more whitelist weaving tokens.

## Weaving Tokens: buy your way in

Aside from receiving weaving tokens through giveaways and contests, investors may opt to just buy the weaving tokens. We've made sure that even including the cost of buying the weaving token, the buy tax will still be lower than the initial launch buy tax.

## Soft caps, hard caps, time caps and end timers.

Each weaving round will have a soft cap, a hard cap, a time cap, and an end timer. The first marker to reach will be the soft cap in sales amount. Once that soft cap is reached, the time cap will start running. The weaving round will stop as soon as either the hard cap in sales is reached, or the time cap is reached. From that point on no more weaving tokens will be sold and the end timer starts running. Investors will have until the end of the end timer to spend whatever weaving tokens they still have. This last chance at spending weaving tokens does mean that under certain conditions the “hard cap” does not put a “hard limit” on sales for that Weaving round. After the end timer has run out, the weaving token of that round becomes useless.

## Presale Whale Counter

Carpet DeFi is expressly whale friendly, because our protocol makes any whale move benefit the community without exception. We therefore would like to offer whales the option to completely circumvent the hassle of working with weaving tokens. Each weaving round has its own Presale Whale Counter and any buys at that counter will ignore the need of a weaving token entirely. The minimum to buy at the Presale Whale Counter for each round is as follows:

- Weaving round 1: 10k USDC
- Weaving round 2: 15k USDC
- Weaving round 3: 20k USDC

### Weaving round 1: $Thread token

- $Thread price: 0.05 USDC
- Buy Tax: 12%
- Soft Cap: 50k USDC
- Hard Cap: 150k USDC
- Time Cap: 72 hours
- End timer: 72 hours
- Whale threshold: 10k USDC
- Tax allocation (12% is the total): 2% BT, 10% Marketing

### Weaving round 2: $Weave token

- $Weave price: 0.04 USDC
- Buy Tax: 18%
- Soft Cap: 200k USDC
- Hard Cap: 600k USDC
- Time Cap: 1 week
- End timer: 72 hours
- Whale threshold: 15k USDC
- Tax allocation (18% is the total): 5% BT, 3% GSS, 10% Marketing

### Weaving round 3: $Dye token

## Weaving round reruns

Although it is highly unlikely, we’ve planned for the possibility of people acquiring eaving tokens and then not spending them. We initially mint a number of weaving tokens equal to the hard cap of the weaving round. If somehow the soft cap of the weaving round is not met within 72 hours after the entire amount of the weaving tokens is allocated, we will initiate the end timer for that round. At the end of the end timer, we’ll call on the genies and rerun the weaving round with a new weaving token. All Carpet sales from the failed weaving round will still be final, so there is no cause for worry for any investor.
