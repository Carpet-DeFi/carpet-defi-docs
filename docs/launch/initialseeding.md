# Seed Rounds

## THIS PAGE IS WIP, MATH MAY BE INCORRECT FOR SOME PARTS

The protocol will be starting off with seed rounds to raise funds for marketing costs, protocol costs and seeding the initial Risk Treasury.

The seed rounds will be comprised of multiple stages, with each paying for the marketing costs of the next round. This incremental approach is beneficial because the team has low capital to start the protocol.

Seed rounds get progressively less attractive while still remaining attractive, with earlier investors being rewarded more.

To enter a seed round, you have to purchase **seed tokens** which whitelist you to be able to buy a particular amount of $CARPET. For example, if you have some seed tokens, you can spend it along with the amount of USD needed to purchase 1 CARPET.

Each seed token will cost different amounts depending on which seed round it is, and 1 seed token will permit you to buy 1 USD worth of CARPET.

Each seed round has a hard cap and a soft cap. Once the soft cap is reached, a timer is started. Once this timer ends or when the hard cap is reached, the sale is over.

After a seed round is over, you will have 72 hours to use your seed tokens otherwise they will become useless.

If the seed round ends without at least `soft cap` number of tokens spent, the seed tokens will be invalidated and a new seed round will start with `hard cap - tokens spent` amount of seed tokens.

These seed tokens can be earned in giveaways and promotional events!

You are able to sell inside a seed round, however you will incur the full 30% fee.
