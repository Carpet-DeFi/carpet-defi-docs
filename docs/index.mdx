# Introduction to Carpet DeFi

Carpet DeFi is an upcoming protocol focusing on sustainably maintaining and increasing holder value.

:::info

This is called **Number Go Up Technology :tm:!** Your CARPET holdings will always grow in value over time, the price at one moment is always greater or equal to any price in any other previous point in time.

:::

## What? How?

> The following assumes you have basic knowledge of how AMMs (automated market makers) work, and what buy/sell taxes are.

Good question. But first, you have to forget all that you know about decentralized exchanges.

The protocol token CARPET is backed by a basket of stablecoins. Currently we plan to launch with USDC, but in the future, more stablecoins will be added.

You can only trade CARPET with the Counter (our protocol-run exchange), rather than an external AMM, we call this **Protocol Owned Liquidity 2.0**. The protocol charges exchange fees, which make the price go up.

Price is determined by a simple formula, the `total backing value / total CARPET supply`.

<Explanation />

## Why not just stake stablecoins?

The Carpet protocol will not only earn from lending out stablecoins on safe platforms but will also earn from Risk Treasury investments.
