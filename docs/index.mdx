# Introduction to Carpet DeFi

Carpet DeFi is a value protocol, loosely based on [WAND Investments' number-go-up technology](https://medium.com/coinmonks/wand-investments-whitepaper-reconciling-safety-sustainability-and-rewards-in-defi-ba20d96213). **Your CARPETs will always rise in value** _(unless something ridiculous happens)_

:::info

This is called the Positive Value Invariant! Your CARPET holdings will always grow in value over time, the price at one moment is always greater or equal to any price in any other previous point in time.

## What? How?

> The following assumes you have basic knowledge of how AMMs (automated market makers) work, and what buy/sell taxes are.

Good question. But first, you have to forget all that you know about decentralized exchanges.

The protocol token CARPET is backed by a basket of stablecoins. Currently we plan to launch with MIM & USDC, but in the future, more stablecoins will be added.

You can only trade CARPET with the Counter (our protocol-owned exchange), rather than an external AMM, we call this **Protocol Owned Liquidity 2.0**. The protocol charges exchange fees, which make the price go up.

Price is determined by a simple formula, the `total backing value / total CARPET supply`.

:::info Some minor nitpicking

_Technically_, the exchange price is not truly the real-time backing formula. The exchange takes a "snapshot" of the result on the first trade of an exchange "epoch" (1 minute minimum), meaning you could get a pretty good deal if you buy after a whale, but be quick!

_(This technically doesn't violate the Positive Value Invariant)_
