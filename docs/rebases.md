# Rebases and Rollups

Rebases happen every 6 hours and automatically make your CARPET balance rise. We call this APeY because it only serves to attract apes and is useless for all else.

You can "roll up" your CARPET into rCARPET to remove rebases from the equation, allowing for easier monitoring and for tax reasons.
