# Carpet Finance as a story

Some people are better at stories than at numbers. And since we’re a magical Carpet Store, we have no trouble romanticising our tokenomics a little bit.

## Up in the clouds

Imagine that you’re climbing up in the clouds. Maybe a scene like in the Avatar movie, and please imagine to have no fear of heights. Imagine that the height of your climbing symbolises your investment portfolio.

Good trades make you climb higher and bad trades make you fall a little. But you’re weary of all these difficult trades, and you’d like a simpler solution.

Luckily you all carry a little lamp with a genie that is a salesperson of our magical Carpet Store. And with that genie you can order a magical $CARPET that makes the climb a lot easier.

## Jumps fuel the flying magic

When the genie summons the $CARPET, he summons it a little bit under you, so that you can jump on.

And when you decide to get off the $CARPET, you’re also required to jump down. So both jumping on and off the $CARPET will make your portfolio drop a little. However, it is exactly these jumps that fuel a large part of the magic of the $CARPET, and while you’re sitting on your $CARPET, the jumping on and off of other people makes you go up all the time.

## Underlying flying magic

While the jumps of people do a lot to fuel the magic of $CARPET, there is the underlying magic of the BT and the RT investments that always make the $CARPET go up, even if nobody jumps. So comfy,
you might never want to get off again.

The End. Yay, what a wonderful story!
