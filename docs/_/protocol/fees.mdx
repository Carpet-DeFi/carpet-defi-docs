# Fees & Taxes

We enforce taxes on trading & transferring tokens to other wallets.

These fees drive the value upwards, and will be reduced down to 5% in the future, depending on trading volume.

### Exchange Fee

30% exchange fee, meaning you will earn 30% less USD or CARPET. 60% of this fee is sent to the backing treasury and 40% is sent to the risk treasury.

The exchange fee will decrease by 0.5% from 30% for every 200 thousand dollars traded (cumulative trading volume, buy or sell) until reaching 5% at 10 million dollars traded.

### Transfer Fee

30% transfer fee, meaning the receiver will get 30% less CARPET than you sent. 60% of this fee is burnt and 40% is sent to the risk treasury.

The transfer fee will decrease by 0.5% from 30% for every 200 thousand dollars traded (cumulative trading volume, buy or sell) until reaching 5% at 10 million dollars traded.
