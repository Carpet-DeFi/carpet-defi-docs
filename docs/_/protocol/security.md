# Security

At Carpet, we take security seriously.
That's why we use a 4/6 multisig for administrative actions, whose members are the core team. Most of our team is also doxxed and are very reputable individuals!

Our smart contracts will be audited by 0xGuard on launch and in the future potentially CertiK or another large auditing firm.

All software has bugs, every programmer makes mistakes! This is beta software! Don't put too much in.
